The PS1 evolved through several motherboard revisions, which are not tied to a
specific PlayStation [model number](/models.md).

The motherboard have a large and visible major revision number, usually starting
with `PU-` followed by a number. Just below that number, there is a more
detailed "part number". The last two digits of the part number indicate a minor
revision of the motherboard, which may include changes to the layout,
components, or other details.

Noticeably, two identical motherboards with the same major and minor revision
will have the same layout, but may have different ICs or other components.

See the following 3 variants of the `PU-20` motherboard (two of them from random
Google searches and one from [repairdats.com]), all of them on revision `12`.

Two of them uses SEC KM48V514DJ-6 RAM ICs, while another one uses OKI
M51V4805D-60J. Two of them have a CXD8606BQ CPU, while the third one has a
CXD8606AQ CPU. All of them have the same GPU CXD8561Q, but two of them have been
manufactured in Japan and one in Korea.
