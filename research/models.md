Throughout its life, the PS1 has changed, at times in significant ways. The
changes have happened at different layers of the system. For example, the main
RAM was originally split into four separate Integrated Circuits, but later
revisions of the PS1 used a single IC for the same purpose. These "invisible"
changes did not trigger a new model number (but rather a new "moderboard
revision").

Model numbers have changed throughout the history of the PS1, to reflect changes
in the user-facing features. The consumer models of the PS1 are identified by
the `SCPH-` prefix and a model number. The last digit of the model number
indicates the region for which the PS1 was manufactured. Not every evolution of
the PS1 has been released in every region, and there are a few regional
exclusives.

| Region code | Region |
|-------------|--------|
| `0`         | Japan  |
| `1`         | North America |
| `2`         | Europe  |
| `3`         | Asia    |

The following table lists the consumer models of the PS1, along with the regions
in which they were released.

## SCPH-100x

Released in Japan, North America and Europe, the SCPH-1000 was the first
consumer model of the PS1. It was released in December 1994 in Japan.

This Japanese model was the only one ever to have an S-Video output port. Beyond
that it would also have the parallel and serial ports, full A/V output (RCA),
and even an RFU output (allowing it to be connected to a TV using a standard
antenna cable).

The North American and European models (SCPH-1001 and SCPH-1002) were released
only in September 1995, just after the release of the SCPH-3000 in Japan, on
which they were based.

## SCPH-3000 (and SCPH-3500)

The second revision of the Japan market PS1, the SCPH-3000 was released in July
1995. The only significant change in this model was the removal of the S-Video
output port.

Confusingly, the SCPH-3000 hardware revision was the basis for the first
releases for the North American and European markets which were numbered
SCPH-1001 and SCPH-1002, respectively.

## SCPH-500x

Released in June 1996 in Japan, and later in the rest of Asia and _probably_
(but not confirmed) in North America. The only significant change in this model
is the GPU, which changed from a VRAM to an SGRAM configuration, which improved
the render speeds, especially with transparency effects. This new GPU also
improved the shading and dithering algorithms, producing less visible artifacts
(color banding) in the final image.

## SCPH-550x

With this model, released in November 1996 in Japan, the CD-ROM drive received a
significant stability upgrade, allowing it to read discs more reliably and with
reduced tearing. This revision sees the removal of the RCA A/V output and RFU
output ports. From thisrevision onwards, the PS1 would only have a single "AV
Multi Out" port, which consolidated all the video and audio outputs into a
single proprietary connector.

## SCPH-700x

Released in November 1997 in Japan, the SCPH-700x series had a number of
changes, primarily aimed at reducing the cost of manufacturing.

- The high-quality, and probably expnsive, Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)
    manufactured by AKM was replaced with a cheaper one.
- Any overheating issues that plagued the previous models were addressed in this
    revision.
- The SoundScope, a feature that allowed the PS1 to produce visualizations of
    the audio being played (only when reproducing Audio CDs), was introduced in
    this model.
- The DualShock controller became the standard controller for this model,
    replacing the original controller.

## SCPH-750x

More cost-cutting measures were introduced in this model, which started
releasing in April 1998:

- The DAC and the whole of the SPU become were merged in a single IC, which also
    served as the CD-ROM controller.
- All versions of this model have a single IC for the main RAM, instead of the
    four separate ICs used in previous models.
- The plastic CD-ROM drive was replaced with a more reliable metal one.

## SCPH-900x

Released in June 1999, this is the final revision of the original PS1. The most
significant change in this model is the removal of the parallel port which had
been abused to run unlicensed software.

## SCPH-10x

Released as the PSOne in June 2000, this model was a complete redesign of the
motherboard, which was now much smaller and more compact. The controller and
memory card controller became integrated into the motherboard, which lost the
serial port. Additionally the PSU was now external (this was probably the
biggest contributor to the size reduction).

## The odd ones

- **SCPH-3500**: This model is an SCPH-3000 sold in a different box, with
    a second controller.
- **SCPH-5001**: It's unclear whether this model actually exists. It would be
    the North American version of the SCPH-5000. It is mentioned in an official
    repair manual, but there's rare evidence of it existing in the wild.
- **SCPH-5552**: This model is an SCPH-5502 sold in a different box, with
    a second controller.
- **SCPH-5903**: this rare model, an asian market exclusive, was capable of
    reproducing Video CDs.
